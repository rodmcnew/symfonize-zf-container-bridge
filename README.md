# Symfonize ZF Container-Bridge
Allows you to use the Symfony 2 DI container in Zend Framework 2 apps

See the readme at https://github.com/reliv/symfonize-zf for more docs.

A bridge between the SF DI container and the ZF service manager. Requests for ZF-module-defined services from the SF container work. Requests for SF-bundle-defined services from the ZF service manager also work.
